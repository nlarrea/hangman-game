# Hangman Game

Who has never played the Hangman Game? This is a simple game where you have to guess a word by suggesting letters. If you *guess wrong 6 times*, **you lose**. If you *guess right* before, **you win**.

This repository has been created for the sole purpose of practicing the little things I have been learning on my own. So, I know it has a lot of things to improve. Don't hesitate to let me know, I'm here to learn!

Hope you enjoy it! ☺️
